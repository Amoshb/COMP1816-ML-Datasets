# ML Regression & Classification â€“ COMP1816 Coursework

This project implements two core machine learning tasks â€” **regression** and **classification** â€” using Scikit-Learn, GridSearchCV, and ensemble learning techniques. Developed for the COMP1816 module at the University of Greenwich, it showcases model building, tuning, evaluation, and critical analysis on two real-world datasets.
